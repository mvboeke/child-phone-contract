Dear Son,

Happy birthday buddy! You’re now the proud owner of your first mobile phone. You’ve proven you can use your agency to make good decisions, and we’re excited to see how technology will enhance your decision making.
Below are rules and guidelines you'll need to follow now thaty you have a phone. Failure to follow these rules will result in your phone being confiscated.

## The four main rules

- This phone is primarily for your safety. Be responsible for knowing how to call for help and when.
- Keep your phone on you and keep it charged each day.
- We will always know your password and will check the browser history and messages from time to time.
- Always answer and/or return messages or phone calls from Mom and Dad.
- Until you’re 18 and living on your own, all decisions about technology and ownership of devices will ultimately be at the discretion of Mom and Dad. We can take away your privileges at any time. We’ll know your passwords. We may check your device or browsing history from time to time. We’ll learn together and counsel with you on decisions. But what we say is final.

## Using this phone

- Be polite. Never hang up on someone you know.
- Treat it carefully and respectfully. If you break it, you are responsible for its repair.
- No phones at times when it’s not acceptable; during mealtimes, at the cinema or at church. Try to remember there are other ways to entertain yourself when you are waiting for someone or something.
- Be in the moment, not in your phone. For example: don't look at your phone and walk at the same time. You'll walk into a lamp-post or some dog poop. It happens.


## This phone and our family

- Your sister is younger and not yet ready to have a phone. Don’t use your phone to tease or taunt her. Don’t brag or deliberately make her feel jealous or left out.
- The phone will go in the cabinet one hour before bedtime every night and not come out until morning.
- Mom and Dad have raised you to be interested in the world around you. You love reading, drawing, and being outside amongst other things. Don’t replace these things with your phone. Instead, use your phone to enhance and expand your hobbies. It may sound trite, but you really do hold more computing power in your hand than the entire Apollo 11 module that landed on the moon. Use it to do equally amazing things!


## This phone and other people

- Do not text, email or say anything using this phone that you wouldn't say in person.
- Follow your school rules on mobile phones.
- Promise you will tell Mom and Dad when you receive suspicious phone calls or messages from people you don't know. If you see anything that scares you, or makes you uncomfortable, speak to Mom and Dad. You won’t be punished for asking for help.


## Using the web and apps

- The web is an amazing place. Use the web for things you would openly share with us. Practice safe, responsible digital behaviour.
- Your personal email address is just that: personal. Be careful about who you share it with.
- Social media can be both wonderful and awful. What you post online stays online and so you are not allowed to have a profile on any social media channel until you are old enough. Until then, you will not allow your friends to post pictures or videos of you on social channels. In return, Mom and Dad will check with you before we post anything online about you or on your behalf.

You’ll make mistakes. Mom and Dad love you, and will ALWAYS be available to listen and to help you learn from your mistakes. Please give us every opportunity to help you become the best person you can be!
